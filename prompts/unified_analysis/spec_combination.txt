I have data from a calibration certificate that shows what parameters were tested for a {{manufacturer}} {{model}}. This certificate data is provided ONLY TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND what parameters we need specifications for.

IMPORTANT: The certificate data below is NOT to be used as reference or truth - it simply shows what parameters we need to find specifications for.

CERTIFICATE DATA:
```json
{{certificate_data}}
```

YOUR TASK: Find the correct manufacturer specifications for this instrument that should have been used during calibration.

I have obtained specifications from two different sources. You must analyze both sources to determine which provides the most accurate and authoritative information for each parameter in the certificate.

PRIORITY ORDER FOR SOURCES (MOST TO LEAST AUTHORITATIVE):
1. MANUAL EXTRACTION - Specifications taken directly from manufacturer manuals/datasheets (ALWAYS PREFER THESE)
2. AI RESEARCH - Specifications researched from general sources

SPECIFICATIONS FROM MANUAL EXTRACTION (PRIMARY SOURCE):
```
{{manual_specs}}
```

SPECIFICATIONS FROM AI RESEARCH (SECONDARY SOURCE):
```
{{ai_specs}}
```

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each parameter in the certificate data (temperature, humidity, etc.), identify the corresponding specifications in both sources
2. STRONGLY PREFER the Manual Extraction specifications when available and applicable
3. Only use AI Research specifications when manual specifications are missing, unclear, or don't cover a specific parameter
4. If there are contradictions, document them and explain your reasoning for your final choice
5. Focus specifically on accuracy/tolerance specifications that relate to the parameters tested in the certificate

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a structured JSON output with the following format:
{
  "manufacturer": "{{manufacturer}}",
  "model": "{{model}}",
  "equipment_type": "{{equipment_type}}",
  "specifications": {
    // Structured specifications grouped by parameter types
    // Each parameter should include at minimum:
    // - ranges
    // - tolerances/accuracies
    // - resolutions (if available)
  },
  "spec_source": "Detailed description of where these specifications came from, including specific manual/datasheet names and page numbers if available",
  "confidence_score": // Number between 0-1 indicating confidence in these specifications,
  "source_analysis": "Detailed explanation of which specifications came from which source and WHY manual specs were preferred (or why AI specs were used if manual specs were insufficient)"
}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. NEVER use certificate data as reference specifications - it's only showing what parameters to look for
2. ALWAYS prefer manual extraction specs over AI research when available
3. Return specifications that would be relevant for VERIFYING the calibration of the parameters shown in the certificate
4. Provide comprehensive source analysis explaining why you chose each specification
